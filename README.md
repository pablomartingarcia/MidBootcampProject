This is the Mid Bootcamp Project for the Data Analysis Bootcamp of Ironhack. 
We have been working as analysts for a real estate company. Our company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.
We include in the repository a python file, a sql file and a tableau file.
